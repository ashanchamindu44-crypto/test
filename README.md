## Branch Strategy

We implemented the following branching strategy:

```
main          ← Production branch (protected, auto-deploys)
  │
  └── develop ← Integration branch
        │
        ├── feature/homepage-layout
        ├── feature/weather-api
        ├── feature/forecast-cards
        └── feature/responsive-design
```

- `main`: Production-ready code, protected branch
- `develop`: Integration branch for feature merging
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development branches

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- Git
- OpenWeatherMap API key (free)

### Getting Your API Key
1. Go to OpenWeatherMap
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to "API Keys" in your account
4. Copy your API key

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ashanchamindu44-crypto/weather-dashboard.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd weather-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Add your API key
# Open src/scripts/app.js and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual API key

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## Deployment Process

### How the CI/CD Pipeline Works:

1. **CI Pipeline (ci.yml):**
   - Triggers on push to `main`, `develop`, and `feature/*` branches
   - Triggers on pull requests to `main` and `develop`
   - Checks out code, installs dependencies
   - Runs lint checks and builds
   - Verifies project structure

2. **Deployment Pipeline (deploy.yml):**
   - Triggers on push to `main` branch only
   - Builds the project
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically

### Manual Deployment:

1. Go to your hosting platform and sign in with GitHub
2. Add New Project
3. Import your `weather-dashboard` repository
4. Set root directory to `src` (if applicable)
5. Deploy

## Project Structure

```
weather-dashboard/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── ci.yml           # CI workflow
│       └── deploy.yml       # Deployment workflow
├── src/
│   └── ...                  # Source files
├── .gitignore               # Git ignore file
├── README.md                # This file
└── package.json             # Node.js configuration
```

## Git Workflow Used

1. Created feature branches from `develop`
2. Made commits with conventional commit messages
3. Created pull requests with descriptions
4. Merged approved PRs to `develop`
5. Merged `develop` to `main` for production releases

### Commit Message Convention:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Formatting changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

## Challenges Faced

1. **API Key Security:**
   - Challenge: Keeping API keys secure in public repository
   - Solution: Using environment variables and documenting the setup process

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - Challenge: Making interface adaptable across all devices
   - Solution: Used CSS media queries and flexible grid layouts

3. **Merge Conflicts:**
   - Challenge: Resolving conflicts when merging feature branches
   - Solution: Used git merge with conflict resolution
